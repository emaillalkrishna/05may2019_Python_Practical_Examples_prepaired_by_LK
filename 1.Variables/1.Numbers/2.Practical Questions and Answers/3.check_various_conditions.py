# # # Question 3 : Numbers â†’
# # # Write a python program to
# # #       accept three numbers from a user and identify and print the greatest among them,
# # #       If the first number is the greatest value then check whether it is even or odd
# # #       If it is even, check that the number is greater than 10 or not
# # #       If it is odd check that the number is less than 20 or not



#
# num1 = float(input(" Please Enter the First number: "))
# num2 = float(input(" Please Enter the Second number: "))
# num3 = float(input(" Please Enter the third number: "))
#
# if (num1 > num2) and (num1 > num3):
#    print("The largest number among the three numbers ", num1)
#
#    if num1 % 2 == 0:
#        print(num1, "This is an even number")
#
#        if num1 > 10:
#            print(num1, "is greater than 10")
#
#        elif num1 < 10:
#            print(num1, "is less than 10")
#
#        else:
#            print(num1, "is equals to 10")
#
#    else:
#        print(num1, "This is an odd number")
#
#        if num1 < 20:
#            print(num1, "is less than 20")
#
#        elif num1 > 20:
